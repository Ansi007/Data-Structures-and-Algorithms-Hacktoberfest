1. Implement Stack ADT
2. Take a number as input and implement a method using a stack to decide whether the number is palindrome or not.
3. Implement a method using a stack that reverses every n digits of a number. and do not reverse where length is lesser. Returns reversed number
Example: Input: 3
		12345678     Output: 32165478
4. Write a function using your stack class/template to check if input(string/char array) contains balanced parenthesis or not.
Note: Change your stack class/template from previous lab accordingly to manage string/char array as input

Input: exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” 
Output: Balanced
Input: exp = “[3*(1+2)^2022]/{7+11}” 
Output: Balanced
Input: exp = “[(])()” 
Output: Not Balanced

5. Implement Stack to perform Expression Evaluation
